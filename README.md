Our topic is US and State Trends on Teen Births. We are looking at trends in teen births from 1990 to 2019 across the entire United States. We are looking at the following age ranges, 15-17, 15-19, and 18-19. From the data we learned that the southern hemisphere has more teen births than the north. Over the 29 years there has been a decrease of 350,000 teen births in the United States.

Data set comes from: https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-U-S-and-State-Trends-on-Teen-Births/y268-sna3

We have designed an interactive website that includes a chloropleth map that includes differnt drop down keys. The map is shaded from lighter to darker baseed on the lower to higher state rate. On the map you are able to hover over every state to get the state name, rate and chosen age group and year.

Also, you can see that there has been a decrease in births since 1990. There was then an increase in births in 2007 and then another steady decrease in births since then.

Closing thoughts on why teen pregnacies have decreased since 1990. One reason would be because of increased access to contraceptives. Planned parenthood has increased in availability since 1990. They specialize in family planning clinics and offering multiple different resource to young teens. Also, The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was established in 2010. This made it so insurance would cover the cost of contraceptives. Another reason is becuase of public health initiatives. These include Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TTP) and Title X Family Planning Program. Both these initiatives support pregnant and new parenting teens. They also support responsibe sexual behavior. A third reason is because of increased opportunities for women. There are more opportunities for women in higher education along with pursuing careers after college.
