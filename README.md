# Project_Three_Group_3

Our topic is US and State Trends on Teen Births. We are looking at trends in teen births from 1990 to 2019 across the entire United States. We are looking at the following age ranges, 15-17, 15-19, and 18-19. From the data we learned that the southern hemisphere has more teen births than the north. Over the 29 years there has been a decrease of 350,000 teen births in the United States.

Data set comes from: https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-U-S-and-State-Trends-on-Teen-Births/y268-sna3

We have designed an interactive website that includes a chloropleth map that includes differnt drop down keys. The map is shaded from lighter to darker baseed on the lower to higher state rate. On the map you are able to hover over every state to get the state name, rate and chosen age group and year.  




Also, you can see that there has been a decrease in births since 1990. There was then an increase in births in 2007 and then another steady decrease in births since then.
